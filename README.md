# Base-Roleplay-Script
Gamemode for GTA: San Andreas's SA:MP modification.

### Introduction

> I'd like to call this an "advanced" base-script for a role-play gamemode server. I wrote the entire script from scratch and started the development on August 11th, 2017. After spending months on learning PAWN, I decided to make my own script from scratch. I spent few months on scripting my primary script and did pretty good and reached 30,000 lines of code with little to no bugs which I was proud of. I decided to make another script for release and just to get opinions and criticism from other members of the SA-MP forums and track my progression.
